## High level Architecture:
* Service Layer: contains the Business Logic or book store operations
* Models Layer: where our classes and enums are
* BookStores/ Usage layer: QuantumBookStore handles some logic and deals with  
service layer  
## obvious design patterns
* I used the Strategy pattern to handle different book types  
that require different logic
* I used the Simple Factory Pattern to create the needed strategy for each book type
and cached them in a hashmap
